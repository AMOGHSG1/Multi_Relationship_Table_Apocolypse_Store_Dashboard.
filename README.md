#  Apocolypes Store Sales Dashboard - Power BI Project

![Dashboard Screenshot](Dashboard_screenshot.png)

## Project Overview

This project is a comprehensive **Power BI dashboard** designed to analyze sales data for a fictional survival gear store: **"Apocolypes Store"**. The dashboard enables stakeholders to track product sales, production costs, customer behavior, and regional performance using interactive visuals and DAX measures.

##  Custom Design 

To enhance visual clarity and user engagement, I **designed a custom dashboard background using Adobe Photoshop and Power point**. This provided a clean, modern, and branded look tailored specifically for the Apocolypes Store theme.

## üõ†Data Modeling

I used **Power BI's data model** features to join **4 related tables** using multi-relationship schema. Key transformations and modeling steps:

- **Joined Tables**: Used relationships based on keys like `Product ID`, `Customer ID`.
- **Data Cleaning**: Removed nulls, fixed types, renamed columns for readability.
- **DAX Measures**: Created calculated fields like:
  - `Total Income`
  - `Production Cost`
  - `Profit`
  - `Units Sold`
  - Dynamic percentage of products sold by state/customer

##  Key Visualizations

1. **KPI Tiles**: Total Units Sold, Production Cost, Income, and Profit.
2. **Bar Chart**: Total products sold by product.
3. **Line and Column Chart**: Selling Price vs Production Cost by product.
4. **Donut Chart**: Product distribution by U.S. state.
5. **Stacked Bar Chart**: Product sales by customer.
6. **Line Graph**: Daily trend of product sales.
7. **Scatter Plot**: Production Cost vs Selling Price.

##  Insights Derived

- **Top-Selling Product**: Multitool Survival Knife
- **Highest Margin Product**: Backpack (high price vs low cost)
- **Sales by State**: MN and TX show the most purchases
- **Customer Behavior**: ‚ÄúApocolypse Store‚Äù contributed the highest percentage of duct tape sales.
